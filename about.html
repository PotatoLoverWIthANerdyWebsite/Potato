<p style= "text-align: center">Hello. My name is... I'm not telling you. 
I am eleven years old when I made this website on 9/10/18, so whatever date your
reading this, do the math if you wanna know how old I am at the time your reading 
this. Some of my big hobbies are, playing basketball, swimming, reading, and Tae Kwon Doe. I have 
a twin sister who is the same age as me, and to be clear with you, she's pretty 
annoying. I enjoy spending time with my friends, and I love the outdoors. Also, 
I am not what you would call a "girly-girl" at all. I am a complete tomboy. I hate 
dresses, I hate fancy shoes, I hate pink, I basically hate everything that's girly.
(Sorry, girlys.) My favorite color is green, and I basically just wear T-Shirts 
on normal days. I love the Harry  Potter series, and have read all the books and
watched all the movies. Oh, and also, just a random fact about me, I am obsessed 
with doge. Welp, that's all you need to know about me, bye!</p>
