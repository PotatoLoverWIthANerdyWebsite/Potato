<p style="text-align:center">Today in school, we just got back from a three day 
weekend, so everybody was still hyper from that, which was weird! Some of the boys
even went around and noogied some random people on the head. The teachers say I was
probably the only on in their class that wasn't that hyper. It almost looked like
all the kids had taken a 400 pound bag of candy, and dumped it in their mouths.
Oh well, I survived that day. And it's a good thing too; one more second in that 
school, and I would've died. Apart from the hyperness from everybody, it really 
stank in the halls, probably from the sewage pipes, but man it stank! It smelled
like somebody just farted 1,000 times in there, with there friends. Welp, that's really
the only interesting things that happend today, bye!</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Sooooo, I missed one day of the blog, BUTTTTT... as
I said in the home page, I couldn't garentee I would be on everyday; yesterday was
one of those days, so yeah. I had school yesterday and I couldn write then, and 
after school I had TaeKwonDoe practice for one hour, so I couldn't write then...,
and then I had to go to bed, which I was asleep and I couldn do anything then.
Yesterday was a pretty eventful day, unlike today. But we did do something interesting 
at least. In gym today wwe did the mile, we did the mile before, and I got 9:37,
but today I did way worse, I got 10:23. Well, at least I beat all the lazy people,
who got like 15 minutes or something. (My sister was one of those. Ha!) And your 
supposed to walk a mile in 15 minutes, so we had to get under 15 minutes, but some
people went over 15, which is surprising. Oh yeah, and the stench from two days 
ago went away. Whooohooo! (Read my last post to see what "The Stench" is.) That's 
pretty much any interesting thing that happend today. Bye!</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Well, today was kinda stressful. I had two tests in 
school today in English in Science. The Science was easy, but the English test was
a little harder than I thought. Also, I didn't finish the English test in the hour 
I have, (2nd Hour) so I had to stay last hour (7th hour) to finish it. Yeah, I had
to miss my whole Social Studies class, and I love that class! Oh, welp, that was 
not fun, but at least I finished my test so it won't be hanging over me on the weekend.
My parents would probably keep mentioning it to me, until I finish it. That's all 
I have to tell you. Bye!</p>

<p style= "text-align:center">Ok, ok. Sorry I haven't been on in awhile, not. I actullay kind of liked not being on in awhile.
Some weird stuff was happening, and I needed just to have a place other than anywhere
I knew, which is here, right? Today at home, my sister dared me too hang off a
branch of a tree for a whole minute. The branch was maybe 30 feet of the ground or something?
I don't know, but it was high. But, yeah, I did it. I climbed right up there, and 
held on. My sister timed me on a timer like if I was gonna fail or something. No, way!
I totally smashed that thing! Well, to be honest it was kind of easy. I'm not afraid
of heights, so it was a piece of cake. Well, that's it. That's all I have to tell you.
Bye.</p>
