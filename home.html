    <p style="color:ff0000">Hi, and welcome to my webpage! I made this webpage for fun, and now I hope
    that it does get big with you, and the internet, now that I've actully finished
    it, but that'll probably never happen. (I have at least some hope though!) Anyways, this webpage includes a Blog 
    that I will keep you posted on of daily events that happpen to me and my kind've 
    sad life. I probably won't have time to get on the Blog every day, and I hope 
    you forgive me for that, but I will try to get on it most of the time to keep 
    you updated on my, again, sad life. I will also try to keep the Blog as interesting
    as I can, no boring stuff like "today math class was ok", (maybe). This website 
    also includes an About Me page, which, you guessed it, is all about me! Of course
    it is not about every detail of my life, it is just some facts about me, that 
    maybe (I hope) you'll read. Just a reminder this webpage is just for fun, so 
    please, please, don't show any hate. Oh, and, maybe, if you would like me to put
    something on my blog page, say, a story you made, you can just email me at 
    flavia00cecaj@gmail.com.</p>
